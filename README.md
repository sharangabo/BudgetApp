# BudgetApp
This app helps you manage your finances by tracking your income and expenses. You input your financial transactions, categorize them (e.g., food, rent, entertainment), and the app calculates your spending, income, and overall financial health. It provides insights, charts, and alerts to help you stick to your budget, save money, and achieve financial goals.
